# PostMan_Api
Testing Dogs_api and Goals_Api using PostMan Client

For this task i used postman client to test Goals_Api from collage and Dogs_Api from public_apis collection. 
I choose postman because of smooth interface and easy way to adds request of any type, as same as editing the data of the body from request. 
Postman is also connected with mentioned Dogs_Api so there is no problem to copy/paste examples requests from side or find out how that works or to learn how it works.
Client also allows us to set global variables that we would like to keep secret so that others in the group do not have access to them, thus preserving privacy.
